🚔 Crime Data Analysis and Visualization 📊
This project is focused on analyzing and visualizing crime data, specifically vehicle thefts 🚗🔒, using Python 🐍 and popular data science libraries such as Pandas 🐼, Matplotlib 📈, and Folium 🗺️. The code provided here demonstrates how to load a dataset of crime incidents, filter it for geographical information in 2017, and create engaging visualizations 📈🗺️.
Getting Started 🚀
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
📥 Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

🔧 Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib folium

📥 Download the crime dataset (crime.csv) and place it in the input directory. Ensure that the CSV file contains the necessary data fields, including Latitude, Longitude, TYPE, and HOUR.
▶️ Run the code provided in the main script (e.g., crime_analysis.py) to analyze and visualize the crime data.
Project Description 📋
The project consists of the following main components:
Data Loading 📂: The code loads the crime dataset from the input directory and filters the data to remove rows with missing or invalid geographical information (latitude and longitude).
Vehicle Theft Analysis 🚗🔍: The code analyzes the dataset to determine when vehicle thefts are most likely to occur. It groups incidents by the hour of the day and creates a dynamic bar chart to visualize the distribution of thefts throughout the day.
Heatmap Visualization 🗺️🔥: The code uses Folium to create an interactive heatmap of vehicle thefts specifically at 6 PM, which is considered the worst time for thefts. The heatmap provides a visual representation of theft hotspots.
Usage 📝
To run the code, follow these steps:
Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section.
Place the crime.csv dataset in the input directory.
Run the main script, for example:

python crime_analysis.py

This will execute the code and generate engaging visualizations.
Results 📊
After running the code, you should see the following eye-catching visualizations:
A 📊 bar chart depicting the distribution of vehicle thefts by hour of the day.
An interactive Folium 🗺️ heatmap 🌡️ showing vehicle theft hotspots at 6 PM.
